# Node.JS

## What is [NODE.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) ?

#### Per nodejs site: 
* is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8(C++) JavaScript engine.

#### NodeJS in a nutshell: 
    * created by Ryan Dah by taking chromes v8 engine (fastest engine available) and embedded it inside a C++.
    * Trivia: Microsoft Edge uses Chakra, Firefox uses spidermonkey, and chrome uses V8.
    * is a framework for writing server-side JavaScript applications. It is built on top of the V8 JavaScript runtime and uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it perfect for data-intensive, real-time applications.
    * uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient.
    * Browsers provide different objects for us to carry out certain task using JavaScript. With Node, we have objects that allow us to manipulate the file system by creating and deleting folders, query databases directly, and create web servers to serve data. Both Chrome and Node contain the V8 engine, but provide different run time environments that give us access to different objects/tools to leverage different functions.

#### NPM  - Node Package Manager
    * largest package manager available
    * manages automated dependency and package management
    * uses package.json file to manage your  project dependencies
    * you may specify what versions your project depends upon to prevent updates from breaking your project
